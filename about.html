    <p>As you may have figured from my home page, my name is Aarya Shah. But, this is where you will get insights to the juicy information... So I have just graduated highschool. I finished on a good note as I finished with a 93.5 overall average, with my top subjects being math. Talking about math, it is a passion that I seem to adore. My proficiency in math allows me to embrace new topics in a limited time frame. 
    </p>
    <p>Moreover, in order to persue a career in mathematics, I have decided to enhance my techinal skills. As a result, I decided to learn Python, Java, Excel, VBA, Visual Basic, Gamemaker Language, HTML and CSS.
    </p>
    <p>Moving on to some personal information, I am one of two children my parents have and I have lived in Canada my whole life. However, when the time came for me to decide a pathway for my future, I planned to move to Chicago to finish my secondary studies and embark on the next chapter of my life - university. As fate would have it though, the global pandemic disrupted my plans, seeing as international borders closed down when I intended on making the trip. Therfore, I chose to attend the University of Waterloo and that is where you will see me for the next few years.
    </p>
    <p>Moving on, hobbies have shaped my life so far in a way that I am never in a state of misery. May it be travelling, watching movies, being an aviation enthusist, playing cricket, basketball, handball, badminton or even teaching, learning or participating in clubs. Talking about clubs, I have been a part of the cricket team, DECA, sound and stage crew, SAT SHSM mentorship, reading club and math club. My roles range from being a member to an executive.
